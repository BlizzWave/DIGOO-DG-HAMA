These are the flash dumps from the DIGOO DG-HAMA alarm system. <br>

I have done some crude reverese engineering and found out the following. <br>
The alarm has a GigaDevice GD32F107VCT6 (STM32 clone) with 256k of flash memory as its main processor. <br>
It's running Micrium Î¼C/OS-III as its operating system. <br>
It uses a XMC XM25QH64AHIG with 8192k of memory for storage of sounds and bitmaps. <br>

Hopefully this can be helpful to someone.
